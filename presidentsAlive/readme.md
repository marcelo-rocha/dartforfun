resolution of [Challenge #257 Easy In what year were most presidents alive?](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/49aatn/20160307_challenge_257_easy_in_what_year_were/)

US presidents serve four year terms, with most presidents serving one or two terms. Unless a president dies in office, they then live after leaving office.

This challenge, then, given a list of presidents and their dates of birth and dates of death, is to figure out what year the most presidents - future, present, or previous - were alive.
